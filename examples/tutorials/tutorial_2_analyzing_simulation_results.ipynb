In `prodsys`, every single of a simulation run get's tracked and logged, thus allowing to review the complete event log of a simulation run, as in the real world. Similarly, all KPIs can be calculated in the post processing. This allows for a very flexible analysis of the simulation results. `prodsys` allready provides many utility functions for calculating KPIs and plotting the results. In this tutorial, we will explore some of them.\n",
