The `processes_data` module contains the `prodsys.models` classes to represent the processes that can

The following processes are possible:
- `ProductionProcessData`: A process that can be performed on a product by a production resource.
- `CapabilityProcessData`: A process that can be performed on a product by a resource, based on the capability of the resource.
- `TransportProcessData`: A process that can be performed on a product by a transport resource.
