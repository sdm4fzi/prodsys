"""
The `time_model` module contains classes to specify time models in the simulation for the arrival
of products, performance of processes and transports and the duration of states.

The following time models are possible:
- `SequentialTimeModelData`: A time model that is based on a sequence of values.
- `FunctionTimeModelData`: A time model that is based on a distribution function which gets sampled.
- `ManhattanDistanceTimeModelData`: A time model that is based on the manhattan distance between two nodes and a constant velocity.
